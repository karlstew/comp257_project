**Data sets:**
* [ABS 2016 Census Data](https://datapacks.censusdata.abs.gov.au/datapacks/)
* [AEC 2016 election results](https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-24310-Csv.htm)
* [AEC 2016 SA1 vote statistics](https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/2016/downloads.htm)

**Questions**
* How do various measures of socioeconomic and cultural status effect voting patterns?
* If we given a profile of a geographic area can predict how it voted?

**Difficulties**
* Working with aggregated data, only know information about geographic areas, not about individuals
* Accuracy of matching booth level results to SA1 is questionable, (assume uniform distribution?)
* Large amounts of data, may be hard to handle, will have to filter out large amounts of extraneous variables
